snowplow-utils 0.15.0 (2023-09-19)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This full release introduces new "base" macros which are used to recreate the `snowplow_base_events_this_run` and related tables. It gives you the option to customise your session and user identifiers, your partitioning timestamps, and much more. Additionally, we remove the deprecated `snowplow_incremental` materialization that was removed in `0.14.0`, and we add multi-version support for the `get_field` macro for BigQuery.

We have documentation explaining the outlined changes in detail [here](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/) that you can use to explore the base macro changes in particular. For information about how to do this, see our [Advanced Usage of the Utils package](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-models/dbt-utils-data-model/dbt-utils-advanced-operation/) page and the [utils configuration](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-configuration/utils/) variables.

Finally, before we dig into the details, starting with this version all future releases of our dbt packages will be released under the [Snowplow Community License](https://docs.snowplow.io/community-license-1.0/) instead of the Apache 2 license. For what this means for you, check out our [FAQ](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/contributing/community-license-faq/), and our [announcement blog](https://snowplow.io/blog/license-changes-for-snowplow-open-source/).

## Features

---------------------------------------
## Summary
**This is a pre-release version of the package, we believe it to be in working condition but you may encounter bugs and some features may change before the final release.**

This release introduces new "base" macros which are used to recreate the `snowplow_base_events_this_run` and related tables. It gives you the option to customise your session and user identifiers, your partitioning timestamps, and much more. We have temporary docs hosted [here](https://deploy-preview-445--snowplow-docs.netlify.app/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/) that you can use to explore docs related to these changes.

---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version adds the `get_field` macro to enable extracting fields from our self-describing-event and context columns easier and more consistent across warehouses.

## Features
- Add new macro `get_field` to make it easier to extract fields from unstruct/context columns across warehouses

## Upgrading
To upgrade bump the package version in your `packages.yml` file.

## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨

- Column names output by the `get_sde_or_context` macro have been changed from `<context_name>_id/tstamp` to `<context_name>__id/tstamp`. There is no need for you to make any changes unless you have used this macro in a custom model.

## Features
- Add support for contexts with multiple values per event to the `get_sde_or_context` macro

## Upgrading
To upgrade bump the package version in your `packages.yml` file.


snowplow-utils 0.14.0 (2023-03-28)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version makes some big changes by deprecating our `snowplow_incremental` materialization and a few of our other macros, with the goal of providing a simpler usage experience and easier maintenance of the package going forward. We've also added a brand new macro, `get_sde_or_context` to aid working with Self Describing Events or Contexts for our Redshift/Postgres users.

## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
### Deprecated `snowplow_incremental` materialization
We have deprecated the `snowplow_incremental` materialization and will be removing it entirely in a future version. In place we are providing an optimization on top of the built-in `incremental` materialization. To use this optimization for `incremental` materialized models, each model config must have `snowplow_optimize=true` and the following must be added to the top level of your `dbt_project.yml` file:
```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
...
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt
    search_order: ['snowplow_utils', 'dbt']
```

For more information see [here](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-advanced-usage/dbt-incremental-materialization/).

### Deprecated macros
The `get_cluster_by` and `get_partition_by` macros have also been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. These should be replaced by `get_value_by_target_type` which offers the same functionality but more generally.

### `type_string` and `type_max_string`
`type_string` has been entirely removed from the package and should be replaced with calls direct to `dbt.type_string()` instead. In all cases except redshift this should be suitable, for redshift when you need a column of length greater than 256 we provide `type_max_string` instead. For all other warehouses this is just a wrapper to `dbt.type_string()`.



## Features
- Deprecate `get_cluster_by` and `get_partition_by` macro in favor of `get_value_by_target_type`
- Remove `type_string()` and rework `type_max_string()` to prioritize dbt logic where possible
- Deprecated old materialization
- Add new `get_sde_or_context` macro

## Under the hood
- Remove all internal references to `snowplow_incremental` materialization
- Migrate tests to new materialization approach

## Docs
- Update readme

## Upgrading
To upgrade bump the package version in your `packages.yml` file, and follow our [migration guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/utils/#upgrading-to-0140) for the above breaking changes.

snowplow-utils 0.14.0-rc2 (2023-03-10)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
**This is a pre-release version of the package, we believe it to be in working condition but you may encounter bugs and some features may change before the final release.**

This version fixes a few issues from the first release candidate, including failing when you had no data in a scratch table, and deprecates some macros.

As a reminder Users will need to add the following to their `dbt_project.yml` to benefit from the enhancements:
```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
...
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt
    search_order: ['snowplow_utils', 'dbt']
```

For custom models and more details, please refer to our temporary docs page: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-advanced-usage/dbt-incremental-logic-pre-release/

## Features
Deprecate `get_cluster_by` and `get_partition_by` macro in favor of `get_value_by_target_type`
Remove `type_string()` and rework `type_max_string()` to prioritize dbt logic where possible
Fix inability to progress when scratch table contained no data
Ensure type consistency for the `upsert_date_key` throughout query

## Under the hood
Remove all internal references to `snowplow_incremental` materialization
Migrate tests to new materialization approach

snowplow-utils 0.14.0-rc1 (2023-03-06)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
**This is a pre-release version of the package, we believe it to be in working condition but you may encounter bugs and some features may change before the final release.**

This version of the package begins the migration away from our `snowplow_incremental` materialization and instead provides an overwrite to the standard `incremental` materialization to provide the same performance improvements but in a simpler way. We expect users should see little to no performance change from the previous version, please let us know if you see performance degradation for large volumes of data.

Users will need to add the following to their `dbt_project.yml` to benefit from the enhancements:
```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
...
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt
    search_order: ['snowplow_utils', 'dbt']
```

For custom models and more details, please see more details on our temporary docs page: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-advanced-usage/dbt-incremental-logic-pre-release/
